# Intra

Intra is an experimental tool that allows you to test new DNS-over-HTTPS
services that encrypt domain name lookups and prevent manipulation by your
network. It currently supports services from Cloudflare and Google, and
additional options may be added over time.  You can get it from the
Google Play Store [here](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=app.intra).

Features:
* Built-in support for public DNS services from Cloudflare, Quad9 and Google
* Visualization of server performance and application query behavior
* Geocoding of query results to compare against expected regional results
